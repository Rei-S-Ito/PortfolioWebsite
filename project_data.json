        "description": "<p>My role doesn't require me to do any software development but as I've got programming experience, I found some of the responsibilities I had could be automated by writing software.</p><p>One such task was access provisioning. It required the use of SailPointâ€™s Identity Now, which when it comes to provisioning multiple roles at a time, is very repetitive and slow. The major problem I faced was not having access to the site itself as I was not part of the application team and the restrictions around it. I got around this by utilising Selenium, allowing me to create a program that interacted with the website and doing the task for me in quick succession, saving hours of work (and headache).</p><p>Others included writing email based macros in excel for quick and easy data extraction / sending.</p><p>(Unfortunately I am unable to link to the source for security reasons)</p>",
